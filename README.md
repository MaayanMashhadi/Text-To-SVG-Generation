# Text-To-SVG-Generation
This project focuses on generating SVG outputs from textual descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs).

It is part of the M.Sc. thesis project “Enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for Complex SVG Generation from Textual Descriptions”.

The repository includes:

* Pipelines for creating small and large text–image–SVG datasets.

* Scripts for fine-tuning the LLM on these datasets, and inference.
